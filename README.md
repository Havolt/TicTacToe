Follow the link above to use the application.

A tic-tac-toe game I created which allows the player to go play against a computer controlled opponent who uses randomization along with set rules to avoid the player winning. The player can choose whether to play as noughts or crosses.

Once a game has ended the player can choose to replay the game and also is given the choice again on whether to play as noughts or crosses.
